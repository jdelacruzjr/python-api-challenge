# Weather Trends Approaching Equator Analysis

# I created a new repository called 'python-api-challenge' for this project

# I uploaded the following to my GitHub 'python-api-challenge' repository for my submission:

# I uploaded one folder named 'WeatherPy' which contains the following four files named 'WeatherPy', 'VacationPy', 'api_keys.py', and 'README.md' to the 'python-api-challenge' repository

# I also uploaded one folder named 'output_data' inside the 'WeatherPy' folding which contains the .png image files of graphs and maps to accompany the data analysis
 
 # I uploaded this README.md file to accompany my submission
 
 # I created this shareable link to my repository <https://github.com/jdelacruzjr/python-api-challenge.git> and submitted that to to <https://bootcampspot-v2.com>
